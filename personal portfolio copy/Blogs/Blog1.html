          <p class="para">
            Let's define Decision Making. Decision making is just what it sounds
            like: the action or process of making decisions. Sometimes we make
            logical decisions, but there are many times when we make emotional,
            irrational, and confusing choices.

          <p class="para">
            The smartest way to improve your decision making skills is to learn
            mental models. A mental model is a framework or theory that helps to
            explain why the world works the way it does. Each mental model is a
            concept that helps us make sense of the world and offers a way of
            looking at the problems of life.
